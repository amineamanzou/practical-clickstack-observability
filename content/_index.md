---

Welcome to my documentation repository where I share my learning journey toward becoming a ClickHouse Observability Professional (CSP). This knowledge base serves as both a study guide and a reference for anyone interested in observability and the ClickStack ecosystem.

## The ClickHouse Observability Journey

The ClickHouse Observability Professional (CSP) certification validates your knowledge of observability principles and practical implementation skills using the ClickHouse observability solution : ClickStack. This documentation captures my understanding of key concepts, best practices, and implementation details as I prepare for this certification.

## About the Zettelkasten Method

This documentation is structured using the Zettelkasten method, an approach to knowledge management that emphasizes:

- **Atomic notes**: Each page focuses on a single, self-contained concept
- **Connections**: Notes link to related concepts, creating a network of knowledge
- **Progressive building**: The knowledge base grows organically as concepts are explored
- **Discoverability**: Ideas can be found through multiple paths and connections

The Zettelkasten approach allows you to explore this documentation non-linearly, following your interests and making connections between related concepts.

## How to Navigate This Documentation

- Start with the fundamental concepts in each domain
- Follow links to related topics to deepen your understanding
- Use the search function to find specific concepts
- Check the "See Also" sections for connections between topics

Let's begin our observability journey with ClickStack!
